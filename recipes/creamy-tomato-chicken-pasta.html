    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring a large saucepan of water to the boil with 1/2tsp of salt.</li>
        <li>Heat a large frying pan with some oil at a medium high heat.</li>
        <li>Peel and grate the garlic and set to the side.</li>
        <li>Grate the cheese and set to the side.</li>
        <li>When your frying pan is hot, add the diced chicken. <em>Fry until golden brown (8-10 minutes).</em></li>
        <li>When your water is boiling add the pasta. <em>Cook until tender (10-12 minutes).</em></li>
        <li>When the chicken is golden brown <strong>and no longer pink in the middle</strong> add the garlic and oregano for 1 minute.</li>
        <li>When the pasta is cooked, drain in a colander and return to the saucepan. Stir through a small amount of oil to stop it sticking together.</li>
        <li>Add the passata, chicken stock paste, sugar and the water to the chicken. Bring to a boil, and lower the heat to medium.</li>
        <li>When the sauce thickens stir in the baby spinach one handful at a time until wilted.</li>
